# CATS API APP

This is a simple web application that allows users to: 

-Get a list of random cat facts
-View random cat photos
-Choose how many facts or photos to load

##How it Works
-Cat facts are fetched from[MeowFacts API]("https://meowfacts.herokuapp.com/")
-Cat photos are fetched from [The Cat API]("https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search?limit=$")
Axios is used to handle HTTP requests
-Spinner and error messages are displayed for better user experience.
